views on certain issues while our positions are carefully considered and deeply held there is much room for healthy debate and differing opinions we hope being clear about our positions is helpful page overview federal minimum wage climate change energy and technology diversity equity and inclusion equity for black people rights immigration reform housing equity government and technology facial recognition technology counterfeit consumer privacy corporate tax codes the federal minimum wage in the us is too low and should be raised the federal minimum wage is and has not increased since raising the minimum wage would have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of individuals and families across the nation and help address growing income inequality we pay a starting wage of at least an hour to all fulltime temporary and seasonal employees across the us with an average of over across the country this is on top of comprehensive benefits for employees we are using our position as one of the nations largest employers to encourage other companies to raise their wages and to lobby members of congress and state legislatures to raise the minimum wage climate change is real and serious and action is needed from the public and private sectors the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities have been contributing to trends over the past century most leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position we agree and have created the climate commitment to reach the paris agreement years early we are innovating and investing to be carbon by and run on renewable energy by we purchased fully electric delivery vehicles the largest order ever for electric delivery vehicles and we are investing over in climate solutions and reforestation projects around the world to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere now our provides comprehensive reporting on our carbon footprint and progress on our commitments the energy industry should have access to the same technologies as other industries we will continue to provide cloud services to companies in the energy industry to make their legacy businesses less carbon intensive and help them accelerate development of renewable energy businesses we support programs for our own business and we work with partners to reduce their demand for carbon fuel sources diversity equity and inclusion are good for more fundamentally theyre simply right customers represent a wide array of genders races abilities ages religions sexual orientations military status backgrounds and political views its critical that amazon employees are also diverse and that we foster a culture where inclusion is the norm amazon equal pay and since weve been measuring and publishing the ratio over the past several years women have earned between and cents for every dollar that men have earned in the same jobs we also believe its critical that we increase opportunity for underrepresented groups to enter the technology workforce we created amazon future engineer a computer science education program designed to inspire and educate millions of students globally from communities to pursue careers in computer science its not only that diversity equity and inclusion are good for more fundamental than that its simply right the inequitable treatment of black people is unacceptable we stand in solidarity with our black employees customers and partners and we are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear we support legislation to combat misconduct and racial bias in policing efforts to protect and expand voting rights and initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for black people the rights of people must be protected we were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for people we stand together with the community and are working at the us federal and state level on legislation including supporting passage of the equality act amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the standards of care published by the world professional association for health we strongly support the rights of immigrants and immigration reform amazon believes the us should welcome the best and the brightest talent from around the world its imperative for our competitiveness amazon has hundreds of thousands of employees in the us from all backgrounds who are dedicated to inventing on behalf of and serving our customers we support our refugee and immigrant population through our welcome door program which provides new immigration resources and support because we recognize the challenges they face in the us we support and lobby for immigration reform including a legal pathway to citizenship for dreamers and reforms to the green card and visa programs all people should have access to housing they can afford and minority families are disproportionately affected by an affordable housing shortage in the us while only governments at the local state and federal level have the capacity to implement more effective housing policies we believe the private and public sectors can work together to address this challenge we will use our position as a large employer to support innovative housing initiatives and in locations where we have a sizeable presence we will invest directly in efforts where we believe our financial support will make a difference governments at all state and have access to the best technology harnessing the capabilities of advanced technology such as the cloud and machine learning are important to the ongoing safety and security of the country its citizens our communities and the world we will continue to provide us government and public safety agencies access to the most advanced technology and other commercial innovations governments should work quickly to put in place effective regulatory frameworks and guardrails for facial recognition technology facial recognition technology is already solving some complex problems for example amazon has helped locate hundreds of missing children and identify thousands of child sex trafficking victims like most technology facial recognition is meaning it can also be misused we provide guidance to all customers including law enforcement customers on the proper use and we have a clear acceptable use policy however we think that governments and lawmakers should act to regulate the use of this technology to ensure its used appropriately we have proposed guidelines for effective regulatory frameworks and guardrails that would protect individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their application of the technology on june we announced a moratorium on police use of amazons facial recognition technology in the hope that this would give lawmakers around the world including the us congress time to implement appropriate rules and we stand ready to help if requested counterfeiters should receive stronger penalties under federal law counterfeit is one of the few crimes specifically prohibited by the us constitution yet bad actors are undeterred and continue to push their products through online and physical stores harming both consumers and the retail companies that serve them in amazon invested over billion and had more than employees fighting fraud and abuse including counterfeit over the last three years our actions decreased bad actor account creation attempts from million in to million in and finally in amazon supports and lobbies for us federal policies that make intellectual property violations crimes with meaningful penalties and for law enforcement to have resources to appropriately prosecute these crimes we also support a requirement that every package imported into the us clearly identify the person or entity responsible for shipping the product consumer data privacy should be protected under federal law we have built privacy into our services from the ground up and we never sell our customers personal data many core features of the customer experience at amazon depend on us using data responsibly and transparently our approach has led us to follow principles since our founding we disclose in our privacy notice the types of data we collect and the limited circumstances in which we share customer data with third parties we support us federal privacy legislation that requires transparency access to ones own personal information and the ability to delete personal information and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent in the absence of congressional action we support state laws that protect consumers privacy while continuing to allow for innovation corporate tax codes in any country should investment in the economy and job creation in addition tax codes particularly between countries should be coordinated to have neither loopholes that permit artificially lower tax rates nor overlaps that cause higher tax rates or redundant taxation both distort company behavior in ways that dont benefit consumers or the economy we support the organisation for economic cooperation and development and its work with global governments to review the international tax system and secure consensus
