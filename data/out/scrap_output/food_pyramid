majority of plants carry out photosynthesis to transform light energy into chemical energy which is the way that virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things including us humans plants occupy the base of earths food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher thereby functioning as the major source of food for humans and other animals plants photosynthetic activity also produces the air that we breathe almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis still not convinced about the merits of plants consider the fact that many plants not only serve up crucial nutrients and breathable air but also look good doing it many plants are admired for their striking aesthetic qualities and flowers such as tulips
