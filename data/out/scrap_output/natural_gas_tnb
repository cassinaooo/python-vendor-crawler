the suez canal the pipeline and the bab strait are strategic routes for persian gulf oil and natural gas shipments to europe and north america total oil shipments via these routes accounted for about of total oil in the first half of and liquefied natural gas shipments accounted for about of worldwide trade the suez canal and pipeline are located in egypt and connect the red sea with the mediterranean sea the pipeline transports crude oil north through egypt and has a capacity of million barrels per day the bab strait is between the horn of africa and the middle east connecting the red sea to the gulf of aden and arabian sea most exports of petroleum and natural gas from the persian gulf to europe and north america pass through multiple including the suez canal or the pipeline and both the bab and the strait of data source us energy information administration analysis based on tanker natural gas half of oil shipments northbound oil flows toward europe via the suez canal and pipeline fell between and renewed us sanctions on iran reduced all exports from iran including those through the suez canal in addition less crude oil and oil products from middle east producers moved through the suez canal because europe imported less oil from the middle east and more from the united states the pandemic further reduced flows through the suez canal because of slowing global oil demand in the first half of northbound crude oil flowing through the suez canal and pipeline had increased by more than from as demand in europe and the united states rose from lows also western sanctions on oil beginning in early shifted global trade patterns leading europe to import more oil from the middle east via the suez canal and pipeline and less from russia data source us energy information administration analysis based on tanker half of southbound shipments through the suez canal rose significantly between and largely because of western sanctions on oil exports oil exports from russia accounted for of suez southbound oil traffic in the first half of up from in most of those export volumes were destined for india and china which imported mostly crude oil from russia the middle east primarily saudi arabia and the united arab emirates increased imports of refined oil products from russia in and the first half of in order to generate electric power or to store or reexport data source us energy information administration analysis based on tanker half of shipments flows through the suez canal in both directions rose to a combined peak in and of billion cubic feet per day before total flows declined in the first half of to southbound flows more than doubled from to mainly driven by growing exports from the united states and egypt heading to asia in and the first half of southbound volumes via the suez canal declined as us and egyptian exports both favored european destinations over asian markets supplanting some of the natural gas exports that russia historically sent to europe most of the variation in northbound volumes reflects changes in exports to europe via the suez canal compared with asia qatar also sent more to europe in to replace some volumes from russia increasing northbound flows data source us energy information administration analysis based on tanker half of although oil flow trends through the bab strait are similar to those of the suez canal more oil exits the red sea northbound via the suez canal and southbound via the bab strait than enters the red sea through these saudi arabia transports some crude oil from the persian gulf via pipeline to the red sea for export mostly to europe flows through the bab strait have matched those in the suez canal over the last few years because the few import terminals in the

work on trans mountain pipeline expansion project is reportedly over complete and project officials expect construction to conclude early next year when it comes the expansion is expected to nearly triple the pipelines current barrels per day bd capacity to move crude oil from oil sands in landlocked alberta to the pacific coast for export to new customers in asia or along the us west coast the existing trans mountain pipeline currently offers one avenue for waterborne crude oil exports out of canada by moving crude oil from in alberta to a port near vancouver on the coast of british columbia figure the expansion project aims to increase the pipelines current capacity by bd for a total of bd of capacity the canadian government acquired the pipeline from kinder morgan for canadian dollars cad billion in and formed the trans mountain corporation to oversee and manage the pipeline and the expansion project the pipeline expansion which consists of added pipeline capacity that generally runs along a similar route to the current pipeline has faced several legal challenges from environmental activists and canadian first nations groups if the pipeline expansion comes on line early next year as scheduled it is likely to narrow spreads between the prices of west canada select and west texas intermediate crude oils the price differential between and reflects both the difference in quality between light sweet and heavy sour and the logistical constraints sellers in western canada face in moving crude oil to potential buyers increased pipeline availability to ship heavy crude oil to buyers in asia or along the us west coast will increase the number of potential buyers likely increasing competition among buyers and increasing relative prices the effects of more buyers for canadian crude will likely be tempered because buyers will still need complex refinery facilities featuring more advanced refinery units such as cokers to profitably refine most heavy

production accounted for of total crude oil production in canada up from in crude oil is primarily extracted from bituminous oil sands in northeastern alberta which produce a particularly heavy grade of crude oil as indicated by its low gravity regional crude oil producers must employ specialized technologies to extract upgrade and transport the heavy crude oil which sells at a significant discount to lighter crude oil grades such as the us benchmark and the global benchmark brent grades priced at alberta is the most widely used benchmark grade for assessing heavy crude oil prices in

average discount for this year is likely to be less than in because of narrow discounts in the in june when the discount to narrowed to just however the spread has widened again in the second half of increasing to an average of in october and in november refinery maintenance and reduced refinery runs in the united states may have contributed to the widening discount to in recent months unlike exports are limited by a lack of infrastructure to move crude oil to alternative destinations outside of either the united states or canada currently the united states imports the most crude oil from canada by a wide margin us imports from canada have averaged about million bd since according to our petroleum supply monthly figure that figure implies that us imports of crude oil from canada accounted for about of total crude oil production during that time the volume of imports also means canada is the largest source of crude oil imports for the united states and these imports primarily flow to refineries in the midwest and the us gulf coast given the limited ability to export crude oil to waterborne markets the only viable destinations for most of crude oil are nearby refinery hubs via pipelines or costly rail shipments which is primarily produced in inland texas faced similar priced discounts relative to brent for several years until large volumes of pipeline capacity came on line to carry crude oil to coastal export hubs in houston and corpus significant opposition to the pipeline expansion has created uncertainty for the project throughout its development in september approved a route change for a section of pipeline near british columbia to avoid planned construction according to if the route change had not been approved the pipelines completion may have been delayed until december the te nation a first nations group opposed the change from november to november ordered a temporary halt to construction on the project in a wetland area near british columbia after inspectors found several environmental and noncompliance issues construction reportedly resumed after the issues were addressed on november approved preliminary interim tolls for the expanded trans mountain pipeline system contingent on additional information being provided by december the pricing approval is another indicator that the expansion may soon be ready to begin moving crude oil

liquefied natural gas rig count storage other market drivers in the news japan and south korea storage has been at peak monthly levels for most of from august through july the monthly volumes of liquefied natural gas stored at japans aboveground storage tanks reached highs according to data from japans ministry of economy trade and industry similarly south inventory in aboveground storage tanks has reached record levels from october through august the most recent month for which data are available according to south energy economics institute for more than years japan and south korea have been two of the top three importers of globally neither japan nor south korea have international pipeline interconnections and both import all natural gas in the form of since neither country has underground storage facilities natural gas is stored as in aboveground storage tanks colocated with import terminals called terminals japan has the worlds largest storage capacity in aboveground storage tanks located at more than facilities totaling million liquid cubic meters or the equivalent of billion cubic feet bcf of gaseous natural gas in according to data from the international group of liquefied natural gas importers south korea has the worlds storage liquid bcf of gaseous natural in aboveground storage tanks at seven terminals the winter weather was very mild in east asia which contributed to imports and consumption during winter months and further accumulation of in storage tanks in both japan and south korea from january through july monthly storage in japan reached the highest level on record for each month before declining in august and september because of higher consumption from the natural electric generation sector similarly in south korea from january through august monthly storage volume totaled the highest on record for each month inventories at facilities in japan and south korea help meet seasonal swings in natural gas demand particularly in winter months when demand for space heating is highest in japan from january through august the volume of in storage tanks varied between and of available storage capacity over the same period in south korea the volume of in storage tanks varied between and the volume of in aboveground storage tanks is considered an emergency stockpile that can be used if imports from all global sources are halted in japan the stockpile can provide an average of about days based on monthly inventory and natural gas consumption in south korea the stockpile can provide an average of days of supplies lack of

an operational flow order on tuesday calling on shippers to ensure that actual deliveries of gas out of the system must be equal to or less than scheduled deliveries in addition since october the millstone nuclear power station in connecticut has been operating at approximately of capacity which is contributing to increased natural gas consumption for electric power generation to make up for

the preliminary consumption and expenditures data in spring for more information about the two phases of data collection visit about the projected schedule of data releases detailed tables on building characteristics public use on building characteristics november consumption and expenditures ce preliminary estimates spring ce detailed tables and summer may releases data center research findings detailed building characteristics coming soon as part of the data collection we conducted a pilot study of data center buildings to assess the feasibility of publishing data centers as a separate building type a new report data center pilot results discusses this studys approach and key findings we concluded that we would need both a frame and industry cooperation to collect statistically valid building characteristics and energy consumption estimates for data centers we continue to process the data we collected during the survey cycle and we will release detailed building characteristics data later this summer we plan to release the preliminary consumption and expenditures data in spring for further descriptions of the two phases of data collection visit about the projected schedule of data releases detailed tables and public use on building characteristics august consumption and expenditures ce preliminary estimates spring ce detailed tables and summer november preliminary results released the preliminary building characteristics are now available this preliminary data release includes building counts square footage and age of buildings by building size building activity year of construction and census region and division data are available in a table and a the next release in spring or summer of will include more detailed building characteristics which will have similar content as the detailed tables in the last stage of the building characteristics data release will publish the raw data files the recently completed its final phase of data collection the energy supplier survey ess collected data from energy providers of buildings that responded to the buildings survey next will combine and process the ess energy usage data with energy usage data from the building respondents energy consumption and expenditures data should be available beginning in spring see about the for further descriptions of the two phases of data collection projected schedule of data releases detailed tables and public use on building characteristics spring or summer consumption and expenditures ce preliminary estimates spring ce detailed tables and spring or summer september data releases start soon the first stage of data processing is complete and plans to release preliminary building characteristics estimates in november this preliminary data release will include building counts and total square footage by categories such as building activity census region building size and year of construction the next data release will include more detailed building characteristics in the form of tables and public use files data collection is currently in its second phase the energy supplier survey ess which wraps up this fall since april has been collecting data from energy providers of buildings that responded to the buildings survey after the ess is finished the ess energy usage data will be combined and processed along with energy usage data from the building respondents energy consumption and expenditures data should be available beginning in spring see about the for further descriptions of the two phases of data collection projected schedule of data releases building characteristics preliminary estimates november detailed tables and public use consumption and expenditures ce preliminary estimates spring ce detailed tables and january buildings survey data collection completed the field data collection phase of the has just ended the field period began in employing about interviewers across the united states as interviewers left over the course of the project an additional interviewers were hired and trained the starting sample size for the was about buildings we estimated that about of those buildings would be eligible and respond to the survey to be eligible for the a building must be square feet or larger and at least half the must be for commercial use ie not residential or agricultural participation rates in federal surveys have been declining in recent years included after observing that the presented the most challenging field issues in history we estimate that the resulting sample size will be similar to the which was buildings we aim to publish the first characteristics results this summer after data review and processing at well be following up with the energy suppliers for the responding buildings starting this march the supplier data will provide energy usage and cost data for these buildings june learn how buildings were selected for the the is currently being fielded by interviewers across the united states we sampled about buildings for our starting sample want to learn how those buildings were selected from the stock of more than million commercial buildings see how were buildings selected for the new for the was the introduction of virtual listing which is the use of satellite imagery and gis tools to build the sampling frame to read more about this innovation see virtual listing in the april data collection begins for the training for the field interviewers for the was held april in atlanta ga data collection began april and will continue for about months preliminary results will be available to the public in spring about interviewers participated in a training on they were thoroughly instructed on all the steps necessary to find the sampled building identify the best respondent and complete the interview for the respondents now have the option to the survey via the web for quality control purposes an interviewer will still make an initial visit to each building during the visit interviewers will first validate that the building interviewed is the same one that was sampled if not the results will not be representative of the us building stock second interviewers will orient respondents to the purpose of and offer information about getting started via the web in every case interviewers will still be available on demand to answer any questions or to complete the interview in person if desired was your building contacted to complete the go to for more information and to complete the survey you will need a pin october the questionnaire has been finalized over the past year has held outreach events via engaged in discussions with published a federal register notice and solicited input from building energy experts after gathering all of this input the questionnaire has been finalized and will soon be under review by the office of management and budget here is a summary of the document provides a comparison with the showing which questions have been kept removed and added in a future status update here we will provide a document with the complete set of questions data collection will begin in april for the first time ever respondents will have the option to complete the on their own via a will still offer to conduct the in person with a trained interviewer for those who need or prefer that option we expect to begin publishing data in may a draft questionnaire is available for review would like to thank those who participated in the stakeholder outreach held in early march we have used your feedback to modify the content of the a short amount of time remains for comments on potential improvements to the questionnaire with each new survey cycle we make changes to keep the survey relevant and we welcome your input you can submit feedback to in these ways contacting the survey manager responding to the federal register notice as you review the questionnaire available with the at the link above use this overview of the and outline of the questionnaire which highlights the changes made to date november the next will collect data for calendar year is planning the next commercial buildings energy consumption survey the data collection period will begin in april gathering information for reference year two notable innovations to the study are in the works one is the introduction of satellite imagery and gis tools to build the sampling frame this virtual listing should save time and resources compared to traditional field listing methods the other innovation is that the will offer a web option to building respondents in response to feedback during the the web option will allow respondents the flexibility to complete and submit their data when it is convenient for them and will provide automated methods to attach supporting documents in the coming months will be soliciting input from on planned survey content if you wish to participate please contact survey manager and indicate your area of interest regular project status updates will be provided throughout the survey cycle here may lighting report just published a new report trends in lighting in commercial buildings provides detailed information on lighting from the and reviews trends in commercial lighting going back to the it compares the amount of commercial buildings lit by standard fluorescent compact fluorescent incandescent discharge and halogen lighting across different building activities from to the report also provides information on lighting use by building size and on the use of lighting controls and control strategies february water consumption data for large buildings from the now available estimates of water consumption in large greater than square feet commercial buildings from the are now available in this report water consumption in large buildings summary included in the report are annual water consumption estimates table and daily estimates table additionally a public use file is available for users to perform custom analysis for information on how the data were collected see how was water usage information collected for commercial buildings december building activity subcategory tables from the now available estimates for building activity subcategories are now available in five new tables the detailed tables provide categories for principal building activity but the questionnaire actually collects around different building activities not all of the subcategories have large enough sample counts to provide statistically significant estimates but there are subcategories that were already provided in the public use files and are now pretabulated for characteristics such as building counts building size operating hours and age see tables and which are found in the building activity section of the building characteristics tables for energy consumption estimates see tables and found in the major fuels electricity and natural gas sections respectively of the consumption and expenditures tables for further information on the types of buildings included in each activity subcategory see building activity subcategory examples and definitions additionally minor revisions have been made to detailed tables and in the calculation of the mean square feet per worker column was modified to exclude buildings with zero workers in table the calculation of the median operating hours per week column was modified to include buildings that were never open and in table the calculation of the intensity percentiles were modified to include buildings that do not use any energy may consumption and expenditures detailed tables and public use released the release of the consumption and expenditures data is complete the consumption and expenditures detailed tables are comprised of tables which cover overall electricity natural gas fuel oil and district heat consumption and tables which disaggregate the same energy sources by end use heating cooling lighting etc all of the detailed tables contain extensive row categories of building characteristics the files now contain additional variables for energy consumption and expenditures in total by energy source and by end use these files contain untabulated records for buildings so that data users can create custom tables that are not available through the pretabulated detailed tables they represent commercial buildings from the states and the district of columbia each record corresponds to a single responding sampled building the sample represents an estimated million total buildings in the united states want to learn more about where the consumption estimates come from see how was energy usage information collected in the march first energy usage estimates now available the summary energy consumption estimates have been released the tables present electricity natural gas fuel oil and district heat consumption in total per building per square foot and by end use each table has row categories for building principal building activity year constructed and census region and division within the next two months will be releasing additional tables with many more row categories and adding consumption and expenditures variables to the public use files want to learn more about where the consumption estimates come from see how was energy usage information collected in the december energy usage data coming soon continues to work on end use modeling to complete the processing of the consumption and expenditures data the projected release dates have been adjusted to account for the work remaining projected schedule of data releases building characteristics preliminary estimates released june detailed tables tables summary

commercial buildings from the states and the district of columbia each record corresponds to a single responding sampled building the sample represents an estimated million total buildings in the united states there have been some improvements since the public use data release the data file is no longer split up into groups so one download will provide users with all the variables also in addition to a comma delimited file the data are also available as a data file the files contain replicate weights so that data users can calculate standard errors detailed examples of how to perform these calculations can be found in an extensive users guide and finally the questionnaire has been annotated to be used with the public use files continues to work on processing the consumption and expenditures data the projected release dates have been adjusted slightly to account for the work remaining the energy supplier survey ess was conducted between march and october collecting data from energy providers of buildings in the for which energy usage data was not obtained from the building respondent now the ess energy usage data is being combined and processed with the energy usage from

in previously released totals for in the west north central division within the leased to tenants line in the ownership and occupancy row category that estimate changed from million square feet to million square feet and the total us for buildings leased to tenants changed from million square feet to million square feet it should be noted that all the tables still contain preliminary data and many of the estimates are expected to change slightly when the consumption data are released near the end of this year continues to work on processing the consumption and expenditures data the energy

field data collection phase of the ended last week in the next month home office staff at the survey contractor will continue to work on open cases via telephone interviews with over interviewers deployed across the us starting in the was the largest field collection in the history of has been transmitting cases to every few weeks since may and the data editing phase here at is making good progress we are on track to publish the first characteristics results in late april or early may the consumption and expenditures data releases will follow in about a year the energy suppliers survey ess data collection begins in early spring those data will provide energy usage and cost data for about half the cases august data collection making steady progress the interviewers have been in the field for months now and they have already collected data for about buildings all across the country back here at staff are reviewing the data files as we receive them the information collected in these interviews has already passed through and cleared two levels of automated data checks now were checking all the responses and interviewer comments and running edits that check for item consistency within questionnaires and help to verify that the energy usage data are accurate were also gearing up for the energy suppliers survey ess in this followup survey we will request energy use and cost data directly from the energy suppliers of electricity natural gas fuel oil or district energy ess data collection is on schedule to begin in early spring april the is in the field data collection for the began the week of april about interviewers are visiting buildings across the us to collect data on their structure operational characteristics and energy use in two recent training sessions the interviewers were thoroughly trained on all the steps necessary to complete an interview determining if the building is in scope for the survey making an appointment gaining cooperation using the computer to conduct the interview and scanning utility bills who are these interviewers they are professionals but usually not energy experts many have worked on other surveys of various topics while some are new to interviewing interviewers are an interesting diverse group of people from all walks of life some of their previous or current other occupations include accountants firefighters social workers interior designers caterers military personnel teachers tax preparers government workers geological technicians sales people certified energy managers dairy farmers electrical contractors architects parents and grandparents the skills that they all have in common that make them effective interviewers are the ability to talk to respondents an eye for detail and a talent for organization at least one interviewer is returning to the for the third time after working on the and the this particular experienced interviewer was happy to be back this is my favorite project i find that the majority of the respondents are cooperative many have gotten the advance package of materials and are happy to talk about their building data collection will continue for approximately the next months march countdown to data collection folders with materials for each building case assignment being put start of the field period is just over a month away and there is a lot of activity occurring right now in preparation over buildings across the us have been selected to be interviewed see how will buildings be selected for the for more information on sample selection the contractor is hiring about field interviewers who will visit each of these buildings to determine eligibility for the then they will conduct or by a survey instrument on a laptop computer see the final version of the questionnaire the interviewers will be trained to ensure that high quality data are collected they will begin their training with distance learning modules to acclimate them with the and energy concepts before they travel to the training at the beginning of april they will attend a training session in angeles where they will learn the of the interviewing process and the questionnaire they will get lots of practice with the survey instrument before they hit the streets as soon as they return home from training meanwhile back at home office in md staff are working hard to make sure the logistics are in place materials for each case assignment are carefully being put together including maps and other forms that will allow the interviewer to find the sampled buildings each respondent will be provided a package of materials about the when they are first contacted among other items this package contains worksheets to help the building respondents prepare for the interview and a list of organizations that have encouraged participation in the december area frame construction complete the area frame for the is complete over a month period field listers created lists of buildings in area segments by walking or driving through every street in these segments and recording every commercial building eligible for of these segments are new to the and were in the and are now updated for changes since there are an additional segments that were listed in that will also be part of the area frame see how will buildings be selected for the for more information on how the sample frame is constructed and are preparing these lists for the statistical sampling of buildings that will be selected for the the sampling phase is expected to be completed in january and data collection remains on schedule with a start date expected in april october questionnaire completed after reviewing suggestions from the proposed questionnaire is currently under review by the office of management and budget the survey is administered using a computerized survey instrument but weve provided a paper representation of the questionnaire pages and a summary of the major changes pages here because the computer automates all the question skip patterns the survey is not as long or complicated as it appears september field lister training completed a major milestone in the sample frame construction is complete and the survey contractor trained the listers which are the field staff that will create the area frame portion of the sample frame see how will buildings be selected for the for more information on how the sample frame is constructed two training sessions of three and a half days each were held in bethesda maryland from september through september about listers from across the us were trained using a mix of classroom education and practice listings around the streets of bethesda they learned all about the and how to canvass their assigned geographic areas to list all buildings and record the information that is needed to select the sample of buildings that will be interviewed the field listers hard work and attention to detail will ensure that the sample frame is accurate and complete they are enthusiastic about working on and ready to begin their assignments one field supervisor with many years of experience on various surveys said i cant think of a more important study to be working on right now the listing is now underway and will be complete in november the sample significantly larger than previous cycles will be selected in january and the interviewing of the sampled buildings will begin in april august collects data on water usage in commercial buildings for the first time the round of was the first time in the year history of that commercial buildings were surveyed about water consumption and characteristics these questions were experimental and found the collection of this data to be successful see water data collection in the for details plans to collect water consumption data again in the august releases data on large hospitals from the though most of the data collected as part of the cycle could not be released has been able to produce data on energy characteristics found in large hospitals in the data include estimates of building characteristics energy sources end uses energy management features energy consumption and water consumption for hospital buildings greater than square feet see energy characteristics and energy consumed in large hospital buildings in the united states in for a discussion of the estimates table list for detailed tables and large hospital building methodology report for a methodological report july under construction the sampling frame and the survey contractor are working hard right now to create the sampling frame which is the list from which buildings will be randomly selected to be interviewed for the details of how the sampling frame is constructed see how will buildings be selected for the may enters the final phase of questionnaire design thanks the us green building council for hosting an informative stakeholder meeting on may we had about participants attending and another or participants via representing a variety of industries government trade associations real estate energy consultants advocacy groups architects engineers laboratories and equipment manufacturers presented our planned changes to the questionnaire and took comments from the audience on each questionnaire section slides from the meeting the last steps before the questionnaire is finalized are to write all the new questions according to best practices for survey design and then program them into the survey instrument the is administered by a trained interviewer using a laptop and a structured survey instrument the questionnaire is programmed by using a survey processing language called april last call for stakeholder input we are hard at work reviewing all the great feedback on the questionnaire that weve received to date so far weve heard from the us green building council members of the real estate roundtable such as simon property group and the american institute of architects epa energy star epa office of water national renewable energy laboratory consortium for energy efficiency energy performance measurement institute san diego state university electronics partnership performance buildings systems national trust for historic preservation and center for environmental innovation in roofing thank you all for taking the time to review the questionnaire please join us on may for an update on the revisions that weve made to the questionnaire so far and a discussion of any last potential updates energy information administration stakeholder meeting tuesday may us green building council l street suite washington dc board room please rsvp to by thursday may agenda and slides will be distributed to all by friday may for those who are not able to participate in person we will provide and information march is back and we want your input we have created this section to provide updates on the survey progress after a budget delay in will now be conducted for reference year data collection will begin in april with the first data releases expected in spring main focus now is collaborating with our to develop the questionnaire referred to as the final survey instrument in the graphic below each survey cycle we make changes to keep the survey relevant and we welcome your input you can submit feedback to in these ways responding to our federal register notice contacting the survey manager we will post updates on the progress of the according to the below january funded for collection following the suspension of the commercial buildings energy consumption survey given insurmountable funding constraints in fy has resumed preparations to conduct the next commercial buildings energy consumption survey plans to field the survey in april collecting data for reference year expects to publish the first results of the survey in the first half of fy is now working with to develop the survey instrument will provide regular project status reports to the public throughout the course of the project previously reported that the data do not meet standards for quality credible energy

transit agencies and fuel providers the data include supply of hybrid vehicles and hybrid vehicles from two types of suppliers original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket vehicle converters no newer data are available because has discontinued the annual survey of alternative fueled vehicles form more recent data on are published in oak ridge national transportation energy data book see chapter alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and characteristics federal agencies in the federal fleet maintained nearly and of these vehicles were flexible fuel automobiles and trucks the us postal service accounted for nearly of the vehicles in the fleet and the us department of homeland security accounted for slightly more than vehicles vehicles have historically been the most widely available for fleets to meet the federal mandates and executive orders that require acquisition and alternative fuel use state agencies state agencies have similar shares of vehicle types as the federal government most of the in total state fleets are vehicles and are capable similar to the federal fleets state agencies tend to use flexible fuel vehicles to save money at the pump and to reduce the affect that state fleets have on energy consumption and the environment overall growth in also stems from the epact requirements to add to their fleets established in the state and alternative fuel provider fleet program transit agencies transit agencies primarily have buses for mass transit in metropolitan areas of all alternative fuel buses in use natural gas is by far the most prevalent fuel in fleets in transit agencies reported an inventory of and about of those were buses that consumed million gasoline equivalent gallons of natural gas natural vehicles require less maintenance than vehicles because of cleaner burning engines which result in lower emissions and cleaner environments fuel providers fuel providers are companies whose products qualify as alternative fuels ie electricity natural gas and propane with some exemptions under federal law these companies must include in their annual purchases of vehicles of the reported in use by fuel providers in nearly were flexible fuel vehicles which was the result of vehicle availability and the proximity to refueling stations overall fuel providers have shown steady growth in inventory during the past five years with an increase in fleet size since growth in also stems from the epact requirements to add to their fleets established in the state and alternative fuel provider fleet program what is the data collection requirement under the energy policy act of must collect three kinds of data annual inventory of in use fuel consumed by annual supply of made available by original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket vehicle converters has two data collections form collects data about fuel use and number of vehicles mainly from fleets because data collection does not produce enough survey coverage for local and municipal governments private fleets and household vehicles only publishes the fuel use and the number of vehicles for four fleets federal government agencies state government agencies transit agencies fuel providers for example companies that sell natural gas electricity or propane must have fleet vehicles that use alternative fuels because only publishes information about four fleets we no longer publish national totals on the number of alternative fuel vehicles or on alternative fuel consumption collects data on the supply of from two types of suppliers original equipment manufacturers aftermarket vehicle converters the supply of either manufactured or converted also includes vehicles such as hybrids and hybrids these data are published in the supplier data section but they are not included in the user data section because they are not considered alternative fuel vehicles under the energy policy act of release date may additional tables

these data are usually preliminary and sometimes estimated or forecasted and likely to be revised the following month the first dissemination of most annual data is also preliminary it is often based on monthly estimates and is likely to be revised later that year after final data are published from sources according to source data revision policies and publication schedules in addition may revise
