cells for in vitro fertilization or the treatment for infertility in the future it could be joined by in vitro gametogenesis a new process that could turn any cell first into a stem cell and then into a sperm or egg cell via images its a wednesday morning at the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine in downtown washington dc and dr eli is opening an unprecedented gathering its titled derived human gametes as a reproductive technology its the first workshop to explore gametogenesis or which involves human eggs and sperm in the laboratory from any cell in a persons body it is on the precipice of materialization says a reproductive biology specialist from brown university and will probably never be the same for the next three days dozens of scientists doctors and others describe the latest scientific advances in and explore the potentially thicket of social ethical moral legal and regulatory ramifications of the emerging technology hundreds more attend the workshop remotely the implications here are huge says who studies reproductive health issues at the university of waterloo in canada the realization of the advance for humans likely is still years away but the excitement about it among scientists is growing so far healthy mice japanese scientists describe how theyve already perfected in mice the researchers used cells from the tails of adult mice to create induced pluripotent stem ips cells and then coaxed those ips cells to become mouse sperm and eggs theyve even used those sperm and eggs to make embryos and implanted the embryos into the wombs of female mice which gave birth to apparently healthy mouse pups we are in the pathway of translating these technologies into the humans says from kyoto university addressing the group via zoom in fact says hes fairly far down that pathway hes turned human blood cells into ips cells and used those ips cells to create very primitive human eggs others have created primitive human sperm this way neither the sperm or eggs are developed enough to make embryos or babies but scientists around the world are intensively working on that ive been really impressed with all the data that weve seen here and just how quickly this field is evolving says dr hugh taylor a reproductive health specialist at yale school of medicine it makes me confident that its not a matter of if this will be available for clinical practice but just a matter of when for infertility next the workshop participants who gathered at the end of april explore the implications of if the technology were ever to become a reality for humans this could be for individuals to build that family that they dream of through says andrea who studies infertility at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia would enable infertile women and men to have children with their own instead of genes from the sperm and eggs or donors same goes for women of any age rendering the biological clock irrelevant but that says raises many questions yes its great to be able to not to have to worry as woman that is the cliff that we fall off of she says but on the other hand what are the implications for families for the children that have parents that are older i always think about freshman day in your could also enable gay and trans couples to have babies that are genetically related to both partners we too could point to our children and say he has your eyes and my nose in a way that is something that i think many queer people covet says katherine who studies reproductive health issues at yale law school but also worries that could undermine acceptance of gay people parenting children who arent genetically related to them through adoption or by using other peoples sperm and eggs to the extent the replaces markets in sperm and eggs concerns about backsliding i think are really warranted she says provocative possibilities another theoretical possibility is solo single people having babies with just one persons genes says dr paula a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the oregon health science university in portland in theory you could reproduce with yourself and the resulting child would be percent related to you says you could do that if you wanted to she warns however that may increase the risk for genetic problems in offspring at the same time the for could be obtained from anywhere a single cell could be found says henry a at stanford that raises a long list of other provocative possibilities he says including genetic mothers genetic mothers fetuses that become genetic parents people been dead for three years whose cells were saved who become parents people could even potentially steal the of celebrities from for example a clipping of their hair to make babies he says one law we definitely need is to make sure people cant become genetic parents without their knowledge or consent says throughout the meeting researchers and warn that the ability to create a limitless supply of embryos combined with new techniques could turbocharge the power to eradicate unwanted genes that could help eradicate terrible genetic diseases but also move designer babies even closer to reality the desire to genetically modify the future generation in a hunt for a assumed perfect race perfect baby perfect future generation is not science fiction says amrita a professor of sociology at the university of cape town in south african when used with tools like should make us all worried is probably still at least years away and may never happen several of the participants note there are still significant technical hurdles that would need to be overcome and questions about whether could ever be done safely several experts repeatedly warn during the workshop nevertheless the food and drug administration is already exploring the implications of according to dr peter marks a top official its an important technology that we are very interested in helping to move it forward marks says this creeps out our attorneys dr peter marks but marks notes congress currently prohibits the from even considering any proposals that would involve genetically manipulated human embryos this creeps out our attorneys marks says it makes them feel uncomfortable in this space but if remains in the us marks and others warn clinics could easily spring up in other countries with looser regulations creating a new form of medical tourism that raises even more ethical worries that includes the exploitation of women as surrogate mothers does really increase human wellbeing asks whose wellbeing does it increase others agree the door that opens to this space is one in which so many things are unsettled says michelle director of the center for biotechnology and global health policy at the university of california so
