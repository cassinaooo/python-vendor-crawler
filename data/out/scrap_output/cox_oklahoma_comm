included select plans cons limited availability low customer satisfaction scores to get optimum tv service you must live in connecticut new jersey or new york the bronx brooklyn long island or and you have to tv plans here when you sign up at first choose an internet plan they cost for mbps download speeds cable or fiber depending on your location then add a tv plan for channels premier tv has max and a month thats a great value for so many channels especially with the included premiums our recommended optimum package optimum gig premier tv price standout features channels including max and mbps download speeds free gateway data as of post date offers and availability may vary and are subject to change wired speeds speeds may vary we recommend bundling optimum gig internet a month with premier tv a month the total monthly price would be monthly also you get your first optimum tv box free with optimum bundles or you can an apple tv a month for months instead unless youre bundling with a gig internet plan in which case receive free cloud you will have to pay an extra a month for optimums cloud service thats pretty pricey for hours of storage alternatively you could buy your own which will pay for itself eventually and hold more movies and shows as an upside if youre tired of your current tv provider optimum has no contracts and a contract buyout of up to those are two good reasons to switch to optimum too bad its available in only four states armstrong cable editorial rating service view plans read full review pros no contracts channels with more in packs included modem free installation cons limited availability high prices bundling requirement limited tv choices for new customers armstrong cable is an family business offering internet digital hd tv and telephone service in northeastern us if you like to buy local you know that means paying higher usually for better service if youd rather have the best deal dish spectrum and offer more channels and faster internet for a better price in the same area you might want to go directly to those providers you locally minded customers who want to try armstrong should know that the provider offers tv only in bundles with internet or phone service for a month this pricing is already includes a promotional discount yikes our recommended armstrong cable package zoom extreme television plus price standout features channels up to mbps download speeds data as of post date offers and availability may vary and are subject to change pricing looks even worse when you realize that its main tv plan television plus has only channels armstrong stashes more channels in packs each monthly your exp stream tv box powered by adds per month but its not can use your own compatible streaming device cloud storage is monthly for hours we love supporting shops but were not sure wed pay this much for tv and internet service powered by editorial rating service mos view plans read full review pros affordable pricing first smart box included discounted installation cons contract limited availability limited channels bundle requirement high fees offers bundles with tv internet and phone service in states the providers channel count is low but so are its prices you can get all live tv channels plus a internet connection and a free tv smart box for only monthly thats a pretty good you want more tv channels our recommended package prime internet gig variety tv price standout features channels up to download speeds smart box discounted installation data as of post date offers and availability may vary and are subject to change if more channels are a must we suggest getting gig internet plan a month then signing up for americas top a month channels its a solid combo and at monthly it competes with bundles from optimum and astound you wont enjoy the convenience of a single bill if you want service charges per month for either or service with up to hours of hd storage thats not a great price for such storage but theres another option for existing customers if youre not a new subscriber you can buy the compatible edge for cable theyre about on amazon and get hours of hd storage still have to pay a month for a doesnt charge a fee for the first card unlike most tv providers editorial rating service mos view plans read full review pros no annual contracts guarantee discounts when you bundle tv with internet or phone service cons overpriced tv packages data caps that make digital value pack impractical no channels formerly cable one has modest tv packages with through a streaming device either an amazon fire tv stick provided by or your own compatible device unfortunately pricing isnt so modest at monthly which is an astonishingly high per channel both packages include a cloud which can cost up to a month with other providers but that doesnt improve the value much our recommended package standard cable price standout features channels simultaneous screens streams data as of post date offers and availability may vary and are subject to change to put poor value into perspective the dish americas top has channels for a month per channel and you can add the hopper hours and simultaneous recordings for an extra monthly that comes to dish is available almost anywhere has bundles with internet tv and phone service but the value isnt much better at a month for channels and mbps internet speeds so if you live in area we recommend getting dish for tv and connect gig ultra a month mbps what to look for in a tv provider what really you wanna do your own legwork after all the sweat we put into this just respect you for doing additional research heres a tip sheet for shopping to help you channels quantity vs quality channel counts are only rely solely on them review

lineup channel lineup contracts vs plans nobody likes to be stuck with a provider and a payment that they dont like be sure you understand the terms of your contract from how long your contract lasts to how much you have to pay if you leave before it ends or you can look for providers that dont require contracts like spectrum and optimum some providers like offer plans at a higher monthly fee often this fee is high plans are as much as more than the contract plans we recommend these only if be moving youre living away from home for an extended period contract buyouts some providers will pay to get your business optimum spectrum and all pay up to to free you from your current contract how nice is that specs and fees ideally with physical like the dish hopper and genie you want tons of storage hours or more and multiple tuners at least two ideally more than five to allow for simultaneous recordings the should also run streaming and have a voice remote key features of cloud are storage and simultaneous streams typically cloud storage is lower than that of a physical expect to see providers offering hours as for streams three is a good amount monthly fees for physical and cloud range from with a median rate of a month find the best bang for your buck with dish a month for up to hours and tuners and hours and five tuners for monthly hidden fees when youve spent all this time picking a plan with a good price and cost per channel any extra fee feels like a surprise your provider should disclose these when you subscribe but these details are easy to miss so be on the
