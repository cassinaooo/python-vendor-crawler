always slow even for watching a video the laptop hangs so i complained in the customer care and they came and replaced customer accepted with i bought two from dell and these never deliver to me when i contact to the customer care service they said to me that they trust their carrier companies not me because it happened to me three times they choose the carrier companies and conditions whether to take my customer accepted does issue with support services does it mean when you go to dell support and you enter the service tag and next to support services there is no green circle with a checkmark followed by information about the service status instead there is a red octagon with a horizontal line which seems like a stop sign next to that it customer accepted or not received an email from
