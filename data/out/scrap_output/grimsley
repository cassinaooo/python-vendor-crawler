mechanics determination breeding in the wild safari zone synchronize generations generation vi generation vii generation viii madam celadon list of natures table other applications evolutions battle palace purification other in the spinoff games mystery dungeon series sleep table in the anime in the manga adventures in other languages mechanics a nature usually affects the value of two of its stats ultimately increasing one of its stats attack defense special attack special defense or speed by and decreasing another by starting in and the stats increased or decreased by a nature have respectively a red or blue highlight on a summary screen natures also determine the favorite flavor and its disliked flavor each stat is associated with a flavor and each favorite flavor is the one associated with the stat increased by its nature while it dislikes the flavor associated with the decreased stat for example since the lonely nature increases a attack stat which is associated with the spicy flavor and decreases its defense stat which is associated with the sour flavor a with a lonely nature has spicy as its favorite flavor and dislikes sour flavors every nature represents one of the unique possible combinations of stat increase and decrease thus there are five natures that have no effect on the stat growth as they technically increase and decrease the same stat bashful docile hardy quirky and serious in sword and shield mints were introduced when used on a these items change the effect of a nature on its stats to that of the nature corresponding to the mint used however other traits determined by nature such as a flavor preferences or a evolution are unchanged mints also do not change which nature is passed down using an determination this section is feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it reason when a bred nature is determined in the gen vi games when a roaming nature is determined a nature is determined when it is generated by the game when it is encountered in the wild when it is obtained as an egg or when it is given to the player by a character in the generation iii games except emerald and the generation v games a nature is determined when the player receives the egg from the man in emerald and the generation iv games a nature is determined when the man obtains the egg a nature cannot be changed once generated in generations iii and iv nature is determined by the personality value from generation v onward it is stored in an unrelated variable a transported to bank from a virtual console core series game has its nature set upon being transported its nature is the nature with the index number that corresponds to the total experience in generation i and ii modulo the experience is then reset to the minimum amount of experience required for its current level breeding from emerald onward a ditto or a female that holds an has a chance of passing its nature to its offspring starting in and male can also pass on their nature by holding an from black and white onward a holding an will always pass its nature to its offspring in generation iv the only applies this effect if both have the same language of origin if they do not the method applies instead to attempt to make the shiny thereby unsetting the nature that had previously been set from generation v onward nature is independent of the personality value and so both the and method can apply at once in games where either parent can pass down their nature if both hold an each parent has an equal chance of passing down their nature to the offspring in the wild safari zone in ruby sapphire and emerald there are feeders throughout the safari zone if a is placed in a feeder all wild encountered in tall grass and water tiles up to five steps away from the feeder will have a nature such that if an identical were thrown at it the would be enthralled ie its preferred flavor dominates its disliked flavor in the the feeder has no effect if no such nature exists only one may occupy a feeder and the feeders effect disappears after steps are taken synchronize generations from emerald onward if a with synchronize is in the first slot in the party even if fainted when a wild is encountered there is a chance that the game will force it to have the same nature as the in the first slot otherwise the nature is chosen at random so the still has a in chance of having the same nature as the lead this does not apply to roaming in the or in the entree forest in emerald it also does not apply to stationary such as or generation vi from omega ruby and alpha sapphire onward if a with synchronize is leading the party gift except obtained via mystery gift and eggs that are in the no eggs discovered egg group will always have the same nature as the with this ability generation vii from ultra sun and ultra moon onward if a with synchronize is leading the party gift except obtained via mystery gift and eggs will always have the same nature as the with this ability regardless of egg group generation viii in sword and shield if a with synchronize is leading the party wild are now guaranteed to have the same nature as the leading madam celadon in lets go and lets go the player can pay madam celadon in the celadon center to force all encountered in the wild including in the go park complex and the player must defeat in a battle or received as a gift including revived fossils but not trades or mystery gift to have a specific nature until midnight madam celadon has the player select two flowers whose colors each represent a stat red for attack yellow for defense blue for special attack green for special defense pink for speed the first flower the player chooses determines the stat the nature increases and the second flower determines the stat it decreases while the effect does last for the rest of the day the player can change the nature at any time by paying madam celadon again due to the lack of breeding and abilities this is the only way to influence natures in these games list of natures the following table lists each one of the natures and their effects on a nature japanese

whenever the player defeats a noble or befriends a rideable they are gifted with a plate after the player has managed to quell the last of the five noble the spacetime rift in the sky suddenly expands

has led the galaxy team security corps to the temple of atop mount coronet to deal with a sighted at the spacetime rift after being reinstated in the galaxy team by the player climbs to the summit and defeats in battle finally making him see reason and apologize for doubting them depending on whether the player went to look for the red chain materials with or either or appears at the temple however when the player tries to use the red chain on it the artifact is broken to pieces forcing the player to confront the legendary they manage to catch it but the other legendary then appears as well forcing them to retreat using a clue given by the legendary the player caught crafts the origin ball a ball created from the red chains fragments and a sample of the origin ore which they then decide to use to stop the legendary at mount coronet the player returns to the temple of where the legendary transforms into its origin forme destroying the temple in the process before battling the player the player defeats it and uses the origin ball to catch it causing the spacetime rift to disappear and returning the sky back to normal with the appearance of both and the diamond and pearl clans

legendary as powerful as and which was banished to another world due to its cruelty he takes the player to the ruins of the temple of where he reveals that he was the one who caused the spacetime rift to appear by seeking out in the hopes that and appearance would make appear and allow him to use its power to create a new superior world which would destroy the current world in the process he

world even if it will take him centuries to do so once the player has caught at least one of every nonmythical species they return to the temple of and play the azure flute granting them access to the hall of origin where challenges them once the player has emerged victorious willingly sends a fragment of itself to join them and grants them the legend plate which allows it to change its type spoilers end here blurb action meets in a new kind of adventure research for the regions first catch using your battle stealth and wits answer the call of said to be the creator of this world features the game takes place in the region a version of in the past it features rowlet and as starter and rei and as player characters include the members of the galaxy expedition team and the diamond and pearl clans new and forms seven new and have been introduced and evolve from and respectively while and evolve from the forms of and respectively seventeen new forms for electrode and have been added other new forms have been added for and overworld the player receives a device called the arc phone early in the story which distinctly resembles using it allows the player to see the map and teleport to certain locations such as base camps as well as view their tasks all wild are visible in the overworld like a symbol encounter although colliding with these does not immediately cause a battle to begin different species of respond to the player differently with some having no reaction some fleeing and some becoming aggressive and directly attacking the player if the player sustains too many attacks from aggressive they will be rescued they will gradually have their health restored when not being targeted by a the player may catch a from the overworld by throwing a ball at it without having to start a battle first however if an aggressive is targeting the player it cannot be caught without starting a battle or stunning it with a item hitting a from behind with a ball increases the likelihood of capturing it to battle a wild the player must throw one of their own balls at or near it hitting the wild with the ball from behind will surprise it causing it to not move on its first turn particularly strong and large wild with glowing red eyes known as alpha can appear these are always aggressive and have their stats increased in battle if one is caught it will lose its stat boosts and its eyes will no longer glow although they will still be red in the overworld the player has access to new actions they can crouch to be less visible to wild although this slows movement roll in order to quickly move a short distance while avoiding attacks from aggressive or throw certain items with the aid of an aiming reticle including balls as well as various berries and other such items which can affect the behavior of wild due to the changes to wild encounters tall grass now serves a different purpose the player is less visible to wild while moving through it the flute is a new key item that allows the player to summon and ride on them similar to the ride pager there are five that can be ridden on each unlocked at a different point in the story which can travel on land at high speed and jump which can find hidden items similarly to the dowsing machine which can travel over water and jump up to two times before landing which can climb walls and which can travel through the air is unique among the rideable in that balls and other items can still be thrown while riding it if this is done while it is jumping the game will temporarily slow down to allow for increased precision can be sent out of their balls outside of battle while this can be done no matter what the situation specific uses include using them to gather items from trees and mineral deposits which gives the used a small amount of experience depending on the area and increases their friendship some trees and ore deposits shake if the player attempts to harvest items from these a wild will appear instead and immediately begin a battle that is the time according to the internal clock no longer determines time and the game instead uses its own system by which time passes significantly faster it is also possible to change the time immediately by resting every minute corresponds to an hour thus an day is minutes long in village time does not pass unless the player rests every two nights that pass change the moon phase the full moon allows to evolve into the conditions and mechanics of defeat have been changed the player may take damage in the overworld from attacks by wild or by falling from large heights this damage will gradually heal over time unless the player is being targeted by a wild taking too much damage will cause the player to be rescued upon which the player will lose several of the items in their satchel but none of their money and return to the last visited base camp if the player has achieved first star rank and is connected to the internet items that they drop upon being rescued may appear in other players games as lost satchels if a player collects a lost satchel the items will be returned to their owners item storage and the player who collected the satchel will be rewarded with merit points that can then be used to purchase items at the trading post in village defeat does not occur after all of the in the players party faint if the players entire party is knocked out during a battle against a trainer their party is fully healed and they are given the opportunity to restart the battle with no penalty if the players entire party is knocked out during a battle against a wild the battle ends and there is no other direct consequence however since fainted cannot be sent out the player cannot send out their or by extension start another battle if their entire party is knocked out leaving the player largely defenseless against wild until their are healed outside of village centers have been replaced by base camps which allow for purchasing items accessing stored in pastures accessing the item storage resting to heal or change the time and crafting noble sacred to the people of that have become frenzied by strange lightning act as boss battles with five being fought throughout the story to defeat a noble the player must throw special balms at it to gradually calm it down while avoiding its attacks under certain circumstances the noble will drop its guard and allow the player to engage it in a battle upon having its hp reduced to the noble will be temporarily stunned making balms more effective and allowing the player to throw them without any risk of being attacked after completing the story the player can redo battles against nobles indefinitely with their fastest defeat of each being tracked completing a entry now requires more than just catching a certain once research tasks can also be completed which are tasks involving the such as catching multiple defeating multiple seeing it use certain moves etc a research level will rise as more of its corresponding research tasks are completed filling out more of its entry up to a maximum of level a complete entry obedience has been changed it is now possible for any to disobey even if they are not outsider and their obedience is based on the level they were obtained at rather than their current level completing research tasks and entries rewards the player with points and if they have obtained enough of these they can increase in rank which increases the maximum level a can be obtained at without becoming disobedient mechanics similarly to lets go and lets go and have been replaced by effort levels the mechanics of evolution have been changed if a achieves the requirement for an evolution other than those that use evolution items it will not evolve immediately but instead gain the ability to evolve with the player being able to activate the evolution at any point afterwards at which point it cannot be canceled with the b button additionally several methods of evolution have been slightly changed that evolved by leveling up but also required some other condition to be met now only require for said other condition to be met not needing to be leveled up for example that previously evolved by leveling up with high friendship are now able to evolve immediately after achieving high friendship as in brilliant diamond and shining pearl that evolve in certain locations can now also evolve using evolution stones but unlike in said game this now applies to evolving into and evolving into as well whose evolution methods involved an evolution item in any way including holding the item while leveling up or being traded now all evolve when exposed to the item akin to an evolution stone that evolved by being traded without requiring an item can still evolve in this way but can alternatively evolve by being exposed to a linking cord the process of learning moves has been altered when a that already knows four moves reaches a sufficient level for learning another move it does not immediately attempt to learn the move but instead gets the idea for the move at any time outside of battle the player can freely have a forget its moves and learn moves that it has gotten the idea for and any moves that it forgets in this process can later be relearned using the same method this effectively means that the player has constant access to the services of the move reminder and move deleter of previous games without having to pay anything for them the player can now freely alter a nickname at any time outside of battle as such they are no longer prompted to nickname after obtaining them and the name rater has been removed abilities held items breeding eggs and have been removed item mechanics the players bag is replaced by a satchel which can only store a finite quantity of items similarly to the bag in generation i games the satchel consists of slots for different items though the number of these slots can be increased by paying a member of the galaxy team at the galaxy hall excess items can be placed in the item storage which has enough space for all items but is only accessible from certain areas items can now be combined in order to create new items via crafting the player can only craft an item if they own the recipe for that item crafting can be performed either at a workbench where the player has access to all of their items or in any location via the usage of the crafting kit in which case the player only has access to items in their satchel balls have an appearance in this game with a wooden bottom half a implement instead of a button and a valve on top that puffs out steam on a successful catch balls great balls and ultra balls return in addition to several new ball varieties such as heavy balls and feather balls items sell for a quarter of their purchase price instead of a half battle mechanics the player can now move during battles in most battles against wild the battle will end automatically if the player moves too far away from it in other battles such as battles against trainers there are invisible barriers to prevent this and movement consequently has no effect the game uses a revised system for battles a can master its moves by leveling up a mastered move can be used in one of two new styles in addition to the regular version the strong style which increases the moves power accuracy andor other effects but lowers action speed or the agile style which decreases the moves power andor other effects but raises action speed using a move in either style consumes two pp instead of one unless the move has only one pp left turns have been drastically altered with the introduction of the action order in this new system a turn consists solely of one side performing an action rather than both sides performing an action in the same turn which side is able to act on each turn is decided by each action speed which is affected by a variety of factors primarily each speed stat with a possibility of one side acting for multiple consecutive turns during the battle it is possible to check which sides will be able to act for the next six turns moves that previously had increased priority such as quick attack now increase the users action speed while moves that previously had decreased priority or required recharging such as hyper beam now decrease the users action speed the player is only presented with a menu and thus has an opportunity to run switch or use an item when it is their turn status conditions have received multiple changes the freeze and sleep status conditions have been removed they are replaced by the new status conditions frostbite and drowsy drowsy makes the sometimes fail to move similar to paralysis and increases the damage it takes from direct attacks while frostbite repeatedly damages the similar to burn and poison and reduces its special attack burn poison and frostbite cause damage after each action by the affected due to the alterations to turns status conditions now automatically wear off after several turns furthermore having a status condition no longer renders a immune to other status conditions instead if a is afflicted with a status condition it will replace any condition it had previously the can be with the same status condition in that case the turn count for it will be reset flinching is not present in this game instead moves that cause flinching in other games will instead lower the targets action speed stat changes have received multiple alterations stat changes now simultaneously affect both physical and special stats rather than only one of the two as most did previously stat changes now wear off after several turns increases or decreases to the same stat can no longer stack attempting to increase or decrease a stat that has already been altered in such a way has no effect besides resetting the number of turns before the change wears off accuracy and evasion can no longer be affected by stat changes in the same way as other stats instead a can temporarily obscure itself which makes attacks used against it more likely to miss the following mechanics from previous games are absent the ability to recall upon defeating an opposing one the switch battle style held items due to this the plates are now key items and must be exposed to them to change its form with the blank plate also being introduced to revert it back to its form similarly with the removal of the griseous orb can now switch between its altered forme and origin forme by being exposed to the griseous core a new key item items that require to be held to evolve certain such as upgrade for are now used like evolution stones abilities there are mechanics to simulate flower gift slow start and entry hazards with spikes and stealth rock now causing direct damage along with splinter damage over later turns similar to binding double battles it is possible for the player to battle multiple at once but they can never use more than one at a time themselves in addition these battles allow balls to be thrown even when there are still multiple remaining in battles against multiple moves that hit multiple foes in previous games such as rock slide or bulldoze will only hit one target terrain contact knockout moves bonuses due to friendship or affection connectivity as with other games on switch the game is not compatible with other games of the same generation the game supports online connectivity and trading with other players of legends but does not include battles between players the game received home compatibility on may as part of the version update any brought in from outside of the game will have their ball displayed as a strange ball due to the invalid ball id not being otherwise recognised in this game additionally when a originating from another game first enters this game its is changed to its four
